    All PATCH requests MUST use Content-Type: application/offset+octet-stream, otherwise the server SHOULD return a
    415 Unsupported Media Type status.

    The Upload-Offset headerâ€™s value MUST be equal to the current offset of the resource. In order to achieve parallel
    upload the Concatenation extension MAY be used. If the offsets do not match, the Server MUST respond with the 409
    Conflict status without modifying the upload resource.

    The Client SHOULD send all the remaining bytes of an upload in a single PATCH request, but MAY also use multiple
    small requests successively for scenarios where this is desirable. One example for these situations is when the
    Checksum extension is used.

    The Server MUST acknowledge successful PATCH requests with the 204 No Content status. It MUST include the
    Upload-Offset header containing the new offset. The new offset MUST be the sum of the offset before the PATCH
    request and the number of bytes received and processed or stored during the current PATCH request.

    If the server receives a PATCH request against a non-existent resource it SHOULD return a 404 Not Found status.

    Both Client and Server, SHOULD attempt to detect and handle network errors predictably. They MAY do so by
    checking for read/write socket errors, as well as setting read/write timeouts. A timeout SHOULD be handled by
    closing the underlying connection.

    The Server SHOULD always attempt to store as much of the received data as possible.
